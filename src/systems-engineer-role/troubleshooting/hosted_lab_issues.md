# GitHub Troubleshooting Guide for Virtual Labs: Resolving hosted lab not working as expected. 

# Introduction 
This guide addresses issues you might encounter when a hosted virtual lab isn't functioning correctly. These issues could include the entire lab malfunctioning, or only specific experiments working while others redirect to error pages.

# Purpose of the Document
This document provides a step-by-step approach to resolving problems with hosted virtual labs on GitHub, specifically those deployed on cloud storage (S3). Common issues include unexpected page redirects or errors.

# Who Should Use This Guide?
This guide is intended for:

**Developers:** Individuals actively contributing to or managing code repositories.

**Project Managers:** Those overseeing collaborative projects and workflows on GitHub.

**Anyone Utilizing GitHub:** Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this guide caters to a diverse audience.

# Step by Step Solutions
* Verify Tag Consistency: Ensure the tags used within the lab descriptor file match the actual tags in your codebase. Discrepancies can lead to unexpected behavior.
* Confirm Code Merge: Verify that the code for the malfunctioning experiment(s) has been successfully merged from the testing branch into the main branch. Unmerged code changes won't be reflected in the hosted lab.
* Error Logs: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consult the error logs associated with the virtual lab environment. These logs can provide valuable clues about the specific cause of the problem.
