Amazon CloudWatch is the primary tool for monitoring the infrastructure's performance and health. CloudWatch provides a comprehensive view of metrics, logs, and alarms, enabling the organization to proactively identify and address potential issues.

## Log Management

For log collection, analysis, and storage, Virtual Labs uses Amazon CloudWatch Logs. This service helps the organization gather insights from logs, troubleshoot issues, and maintain an audit trail of infrastructure events.

## Configuration Management

Ansible is the configuration management tool used by Virtual Labs for managing cloud server configurations. Ansible automates configuration management tasks, ensuring consistent and efficient deployment of resources across the infrastructure.

By leveraging these monitoring and management tools, Virtual Labs maintains the performance and stability of its infrastructure, enabling the organization to deliver reliable services and applications to its users.
