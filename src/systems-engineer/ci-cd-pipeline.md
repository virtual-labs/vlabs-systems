# DevOps and CI/CD Pipeline

A robust DevOps and [CI/CD pipeline](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/) is essential for delivering high-quality labs and services while maintaining agility and responsiveness. [Virtual Labs](https://vlead.vlabs.ac.in/) uses tools and processes to manage its codebase, automate deployments, and streamline application delivery.

## Version Control System

Virtual Labs hosts its open-source codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/virtual-labs) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/vlead-projects), the organization's primary version control systems. These platforms enable efficient management of code and configuration files, ensuring that the organization can track and control changes to its applications and services.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

[GitHub CI/CD](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/) is the primary automation solution Virtual Labs uses for testing and deploying applications (labs). This tool streamlines the testing deployment process, allowing the organization to deliver new features and improvements while maintaining high-quality standards rapidly.

## Containerization and Orchestration

Virtual Labs is [implementing](https://github.com/virtual-labs/vlabs-infra) containerization and orchestration solutions to enhance its deployment and management capabilities further. These [technologies](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/container-orchestration) will allow the organization to deploy applications and manage resources more effectively.
