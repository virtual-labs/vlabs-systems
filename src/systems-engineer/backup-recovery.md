# Backup and Recovery

A reliable backup and recovery strategy is essential to protect and preserve critical data and applications. [Virtual Labs](https://vlead.vlabs.ac.in/) has implemented backup and recovery processes for both on-premise and cloud-based resources and plans to expand its backup strategy to include code repositories hosted on GitHub.

## On-Premise Backup

Virtual Labs doesn't have any On-Premise Backups yet.

### Planned GitHub Backup

Virtual Labs hosts its open-source codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/virtual-labs). The organization plans to implement a backup solution using [cronjobs](https://itsfoss.com/cron-job) that will clone all the code repositories onto the on-premise backup servers to ensure the availability and protection of the code repositories. This strategy will provide redundancy for the codebase and ensure the organization can recover its code repositories in case of any issues with GitHub.

## Cloud Backup

Virtual Labs relies on [AWS Volume backups](https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#Volumes:) for cloud-based resources to provide redundancy and enable quick recovery of Amazon EC2 instances. This strategy ensures that the organization can promptly recover its cloud-based instances, applications and data, reducing downtime and minimizing the impact of data loss or system failure.

### Amazon S3 Storage

In addition to AWS Volume backups, Virtual Labs uses [Amazon S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=ap-south-1#) for storing large files due to its cost efficiency, speed, and other features. Amazon S3 provides a scalable and secure storage solution for the organization's large files, further enhancing the backup and recovery capabilities of the infrastructure.

Through implementing these backup and recovery processes and the planned GitHub backup strategy, Virtual Labs maintains the integrity and availability of its critical data and applications, ensuring continuity and minimizing the impact of potential disruptions.
