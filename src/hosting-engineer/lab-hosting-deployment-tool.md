# User Documentation: Hosting of Virtual Labs using deployment tool 

## Introduction

The Virtual Labs Workflow tool streamlines the process of configuring and triggering the deployment of multiple labs. Previously, this was done manually through GitHub, requiring hosting engineers to deploy each lab separately.

## Target User

This tool is designed for hosting engineers of virtual labs responsible for deploying labs efficiently.

## Lab Deployment Process

Lab deployment involves committing descriptors, selecting workflows, and triggering processes. The Virtual Labs Workflow tool simplifies this by providing an interface for committing and triggering workflows for multiple labs with a single click. Additionally, it displays hosting information for deployed labs.

## User Interface
