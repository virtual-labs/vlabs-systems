### Monitoring of GitHub 
1. Hosting Requests
2. Repo Creation requests
3. Permission issues 
4. Rehosting Requests



### Lifecycle of a Hosting Request
    
   - The hosting request will go through the following lifecycle:

   1.  Requester will raise a hosting request issue by duly filling in the details in the '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)'.
   2.  The hosting team will attach the URL of the corresponding onboarding request to the hosting request. If the onboarding request is not found ( by searching on the repo URL), then the hosting team will add its findings and label the issue as *Failed*.
   3.  If the requester is not the repository owner, the hosting team will seek approval from the repository owner. This will be through the above created GitHub hosting request issue.
   4.  The hosting team will honor the hosting request only on receiving the approval from the repository owner else will label the hosting request issue as *Not Approved* 
   5.  On a successful hosting, the hosting team will add the link of the newly hosted content to the hosting request issue. They will also label the issue as *Hosted*.
   6.  However, on failure ( because of missing or incorrect information or repository problems,), the hosting team will label the issue as *Failed*.
   7.  The requester will be responsible for fixing the failed hosting bug and will need to raise a new '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)' to get the unit hosted.
   8.  Once the hosting is successful, the requester will be responsible for the verification of the hosted link.  If the hosting is not as expected, the requester should change the label from *Hosted* to *Reopened*. The requester will also need to specify if he/she would like to revert to the previous hosted image.
   9.  An issue with the *Reopened* label will by default host the repository and branch/tag as specified in the hosting request initially. However, if the requester has specifically requested a revert, the previously hosted image will be restored and the issue will be labeled as *Reverted*.
   10.  If the requester wants to revert to an earlier branch/tag, a new '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)' will need to be raised to get the unit hosted.
   11. Requester will be responsible for closing a hosting request issue by changing the issue status from Open to Closed when the issue is labeled as *Hosted* or *Reopened* or *Reverted* or *Not Approved*.

## Instructions to fill the lab-descriptor while hosting
The following are the instructions to fill or update the lab-descriptor.json file which is used to host a lab. Make Sure that everything in the JSON file is updated correctly before sending it for verification and hosting

### Section I - Lab
Name: Should be Discipline name

Link: - Crosscheck the discipline link from vlab.co.in and update correctly - Discipline Should be in the following format: - Mechanical Engineering - Computer Science and Engineering - Electronics and Communication Engineering - Electrical Engineering - Civil Engineering - Chemical Sciences - Biotechnology and Biomedical Engineering - Physical Sciences - Chemical Engineering - Humanity - Metallurgical and Materials Engineering - Design Engineering - Aerospace Engineering

Lab Name: Should be same in the JSON file, GitHub repo name, and in /var/www/html/

Phase: Mention 2 for phase 2 labs, 3 for phase labs and 4 for phase 4 labs

Deploy: This should be true if we are hosting a lab and exp or only a lab. If we want to host the only exp then it should be false

College Name(Institute Name): Update from the R0 file (which is given in the request for hosting issue) Double check college name as analytics is depended on it

The following are the supported institutes and their ids (to be given in the lab id. Ex:- cse01-iiith)

#### Institute Names and their Idâ€™s:

- [x] IIITHyderabad - iiith
- [x] Amrita - au

Base URL: Crosscheck the lab domain in the reverse proxy and update correctly in the JSON


Introduction: from R0 file

### Section II - Experiment
1. Name: Experiment name from R0 file
2. Short Name: Short name should be in small letters and not more than 4 words or can give exp repo name from GitLab (if it has only 4 words)
3. Repo: Give the experiment repo URL from GitHub or GitLab
4. Tag: For every request of hosting, the repo should have a new tag
5. Deploy: This should be true if we are hosting a lab and exp or only exp. If we want to host the only lab then it should be false

### Section III
Target Audience, Objective, and Courses Alignment: Should be updated from the R0 file.

 - Recommendations

 - Condition 1: if we get a hosting request to update only the lab content, then a hosting person should host only the lab but not the content of the experiments. In the JSON file, deployLab should be true in the lab section, and deploy should be false in the experiments section.

 - Condition 2: if we get a hosting request to update only the experiment content, then a hosting person should host only the experiments but not the lab. In the JSON file, deployLab should be false in the lab section, and deploy should be true in the experiments section.

 - Condition 3: If the lab is hosted multiple times with spelling mistakes or so, then the multiple labs will be created in the analytics and we will lose the lab/experiments usage.

 - Condition 4: if we find the lab name conflicting with the other lab then we should contact the requesting institute and request to review/change the lab name.

 - Condition 5: After hosting the lab, test it thoroughly compared with analytics data.
